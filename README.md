## 📌 Overview

**Dhwanibodh** is an Android-based assistive application designed to support Hindi-speaking children with speech articulation and pronunciation difficulties.

Built during the intense 36-hour grand finale of **Smart India Hackathon 2023**, the solution focused on combining speech recognition, gamification, and child-friendly interaction to make pronunciation practice engaging rather than intimidating.

Developed in collaboration with **Team XLR8-SPARK**.

## 👩‍💻 My Role & Contribution

### 🎮 Gamified Speech Evaluation Module

I designed and developed the **gamification engine** within the application that:

- Awards points for correct pronunciation  
- Deducts points for incorrect articulation  
- Provides instant feedback to encourage learning  
- Creates a reward-driven learning loop to maintain engagement  

The scoring logic was carefully structured to ensure:
- Fair evaluation  
- Clear feedback cycles  
- Motivation without discouragement  

This transformed speech correction from a clinical activity into an interactive learning experience.

### 🎤 National Level Presentation Lead

As per **Smart India Hackathon** grand finale rules, only **one representative per team** was allowed to present the prototype to the national jury panel.

I was selected as:

- The official prototype presenter  
- The face of Team XLR8-SPARK  
- The technical explainer for the gamification and app workflow  

I presented the live working prototype, explained the system architecture, defended technical decisions, and responded to jury questions — contributing directly to securing **1st place at the national level**.

Winning a national-level innovation competition, presenting to a jury panel, publishing research, and building a functional assistive solution, all within a 36-hour pressure cooker, was more than a hackathon experience.

It was leadership.  
It was execution under pressure.  
It was impact-driven innovation.

**Built with purpose. Presented with confidence. Delivered at national scale.** 🚀
